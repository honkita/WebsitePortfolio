# Elite Lu Website Portfolio

## About

This is Elite Lu's official website portfolio.
To introduce myself, hi, my name is Elite Lu, and I am currently a third year student on coop from McMaster University. As of writing this, I am looking for a software developer position. I enjoy developing applications such as websites (learning Flask) and games alongside art. 

## Origin

During the beginning of my third year of university, I decided to start making a website. The website was created originally to learn HTMl, Javascript, and CSS but now has become a hub for my resume and projects. In addition to this, I used this website as an outlet to display my creative side as all the assets were hand drawn by me.

## Why use CSS instead of Bootstrap CSS or Tailwind CSS

For the development of this particular site, I decided against the usage of these frameworks because I wanted more control over what I designed. I wanted my portfolio site to be a representation of who I am as a person and what I am passionate about. I was able to display my artistic side and this allowed me to utilize different features and objects to best fit my needs and wants. I am currently in the process of developing another site with the Spotify API and I am using Bootstrap CSS.
