# Elite Lu Website Portfolio

## About

This is Elite Lu's official website portfolio.

## Origin

During the beginning of my third year of university, I decided to start making a website. The website was created originally to learn HTMl, Javascript, and CSS but now has become a hub for my resume, projects, and references. In addition to this, I used this website as an outlet to display my creative side as all the assets were hand drawn by me.
