# Elite Lu Website Portfolio

## About

This is Elite Lu's official website portfolio.
To introduce myself, hi, my name is Elite Lu, and I am currently a third year student on coop from McMaster University. As of writing this, I am looking for a software developer position. I enjoy developing applications such as websites (learning Flask) and games alongside art. 

## Origin

During the beginning of my third year of university, I decided to start making a website. The website was created originally to learn HTMl, Javascript, and CSS but now has become a hub for my resume and projects. In addition to this, I used this website as an outlet to display my creative side as all the assets were hand drawn by me.

## About the site

Upon entering my site, https://elitelu.com , users are greeted by the homescreen where it shows my name alongside many different buttons leading to my GitHub, LinkedIn, email, and a button to direct the user to the resume page. The top nav bar has two pages, "Home" and "Resume", along with a toggle for light and dark mode on the site. When scrolling on the main page, my introduction and my projects are all listed below.

When navigating to the resume page, the user is greeted with a similar view with the "Resume" button being replaced with a download for the resume. There are two different resumes, one for each of the visibility modes. Below lists my employment, my Language Proficiencies, Framework Proficiencies, Developer Tool Proficiencies, and Education.

## Why use CSS files instead of Bootstrap CSS or Tailwind CSS

For the development of this particular site, I decided against the usage of these frameworks because I wanted more control over what I designed. I wanted my portfolio site to be a representation of who I am as a person and what I am passionate about. I was able to display my artistic side and this allowed me to utilize different features and objects to best fit my needs and wants. I am currently in the process of developing another site with the Spotify API and I am using Bootstrap CSS.
