## About

This is Elite Lu's official website portfolio.
I am currently a fourth (technically fifth because of coop) year student from McMaster University. As of writing this, I am looking for a software developer position. I enjoy developing applications such as websites and games alongside art.

## Origin

During the beginning of my third year of university, I decided to start making a website. The website was created originally to learn HTML, JavaScript, and CSS but now has become a hub for my resume and projects. In addition to this, I used this website as an outlet to display my creative side as all the assets were hand drawn by me.

Afterwards, I rewrote the site using TypeScript instead of JavaScript and changed from Page Router to App Router. This is because I wanted to learn more about TypeScript and the new features of Next.js. I modified the code recently to use the es6 module syntax for the imports and exports.

## FAQ

### Why use CSS files instead of Bootstrap CSS or Tailwind CSS

For the development of this particular site, I decided against the usage of these frameworks because I wanted more control over what I designed. I wanted my portfolio site to be a representation of who I am as a person and what I am passionate about. I was able to display my artistic side and this allowed me to utilize different features and objects to best fit my needs and wants.

Currently, I am using Chakra UI for another application called Kollec, a card organizing app.
